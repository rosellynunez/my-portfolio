                The aim of this project was to create a digital space where users could fully explore and understand the features of these smartwatches, something that the original product page (which can be seen on<a href="https://lotus-watches.com/es-ES/reloj/hombre/lotus/reloj-lotus-50048_1-correa-de-acero-hombre.html" target="_blank">here</a>) didn't provide. The original page only gave minimal information, which wasn't enough to explain the advanced features of the watches—hence the need for this new site.

                As a UX/UI designer on this project, my responsibilities covered a wide range of areas, including:<br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                    Research & Benchmarking: I conducted a thorough user research process, diving into analytics and speaking with real users to better understand their needs when browsing the site. This process also included benchmarking against competitors to identify best practices.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Wireframes & Prototyping: After gathering insights, I created wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma, which allowed us to visualize and iterate on the design quickly.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Collaboration with Development: I worked closely with the development team, ensuring that all designs were feasible within our technical constraints. We used Storybook to streamline the development of reusable components, saving time and improving consistency across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Handoff & QA: Finally, I facilitated a smooth design handoff to the development team and conducted QA testing, reviewing the site to ensure all design elements, paddings, and details were properly implemented.

                    <h4>2. Project Hypothesis and Goals</h4>
                    <p>Hypothesis (V1): </p>
                    <p>The hypothesis we started with was simple: If we provide clear, easy-to-navigate product information and showcase key features of the smartwatches upfront, users will engage more and have a better overall experience. We believed this would make it easier for users to understand the product and, ultimately, drive conversions.</p>
                    <p>
                    The main goals were to:<br>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>
                            Increase user engagement by clearly highlighting the product's smart features.
                            <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                            Create a space where users could quickly find and understand key information, like product configuration and usage instructions.<br><br>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>Hypothesis (V2)</p>
                    <p>If we simplify the navigation and feature key tools like product comparison early in the user journey, we will increase user engagement and conversions.
                    </p><br><br>Key Problems and Findings:<br><br>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>
                            Users were initially overwhelmed by the amount of product information, leading to difficult navigation.
                            <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                            The tools, like product comparison, weren't always easy to find, meaning users had to search more than they should have.
                            <br><br>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Product Goals:
                        </p><br><br>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>
                            Improve engagement by making the site easier to navigate and highlighting the key features of the Smartime collection.
                            <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                            The original site wasn't generating enough traffic, and the aim was to increase user interaction and help users find the right product quickly.
                            <br><br>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Brand Personality: The goal was to reflect the Lotus Smartime brand personality—a balance between the elegance of traditional watches and the modern features of a smartwatch. This was achieved through a clean, tech-forward design that still retained the sophistication expected from Lotus.

                    <h4>3. Stakeholder Requirements and Rationale</h4>
                    <p>The stakeholders came to us with some very specific requirements, which were outlined in detail in the meetings and documents they provided. The priorities were:
                    </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Highlighting product features: They wanted users and retailers, to easily grasp the selling points of each Smartime watch. This was particularly important because, as mentioned, the original product page didn't explain these features well enough.
                            <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                            Providing support for users: The customer suport area was receiving many questions from many users that needed assistance configuring their new smartwatch, so clear, easy-to-find support and FAQ sections were essential.<br><br>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                    Why these decisions? The stakeholders understood that both retailers and end-users would visit the site, each with different goals. Retailers needed a site that could help them sell the product, while end users needed detailed information to fully understand and use their smartwatch. Ensuring the site addressed both these groups was a key priority.

                    <h4>4. Design Process</h4>
                    <p>The design process was straightforward but efficient, given the tight deadlines and because I had other projects working on the same time on my rol of solo ux/ui Designer:
                    </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>
                        User Research and Benchmarking: I started by analyzing similar smartwatch brands to see how they presented product information. The key takeaway was that clarity and simplicity were crucial—users needed to be able to find the most important information quickly, without wading through unnecessary details. I also researched e-commerce best practices for wearable tech to ensure that our site met user expectations.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        Information Architecture and Wireframing: Based on the requirements, I mapped out the user flows and created wireframes that made the navigation as simple as possible. I focused on a mobile-first design, ensuring that users on smaller screens had an intuitive experience.<br><br>
                        <li> 
                        Using Existing Components & Tailwind CSS: Designing and creating new components would have added complexity and delayed the launch, so we agreed to stick with the ones we already had in Bootstrap, but using Tailwind this time.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        Visual Design and Branding: The design stayed true to the Lotus Smartime brand, with a clean, modern aesthetic that highlighted the elegance and tech features of the watches. The color palette was minimal and aligned with the rest of the Lotus brand, but we made sure the smart tech features stood out through visual hierarchy and layout.<br><br>
                        </li>

The goal of the site was to present these watches in a way that would appeal to both tech enthusiasts and more traditional watch lovers.<br><br>I worked with the French marketing team to ensure that each model was showcased in a way that highlighted its unique features, from activity tracking to customizable watch faces.

                    <h4>8. Final Results and Reflections</h4>
                    <p>The Lotus Smartime web app successfully launched and achieved the goals set by the stakeholders. The site provided both retailers and consumers with a user-friendly platform to explore the Smartime collection and learn about the product's features.<br><br>Looking back, there were definitely areas that could have been improved if we had more time. I would have liked to refine the interactivity and add more personalized touches to the user experience. However, given the time constraints, I learned that sometimes it's more important to get a good product out the door rather than perfect every detail. This project taught me the value of balancing pragmatism and perfectionism.</p>
