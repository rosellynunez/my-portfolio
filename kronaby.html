The objective was to enhance the ecommerce experience, strengthen brand consistency across the group, and improve operational efficiency. <br>By migrating from PrestaShop to Festina's digital ecosystem, developed under Bootstrap guidelines, we addressed the challenges of managing and updating multiple brands independently, enabling more efficient and consistent brand management.

                            <div class="col-lg-8 no-padding">
                                <p>When I embarked on this project, I understood that while a UI redesign was possible, it was important to carefully consider the existing app's design and ensure alignment with the brand guidelines. Also, the Kronaby webpage needed to be integrated into the Festina ecosystem. This meant adhering to certain constraints, such as maintaining consistency in the product grid and product pages across all brands due to technical limitations.<br>
                                Therefore, my focus was on preserving what was working effectively while significantly improving areas that required enhancement. Unfortunately, the original webpage lacked integration with Google Analytics or any other performance tracking tools. The only available data indicated a lack of online purchases, prompting my initial steps to focus on:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                    Investigation: Interviews with users provided insights into their expectations, and on the other hand, interviews with stakeholders and the team that was working with this brans since it was born. This both points of view helped me to align the website with what mattered most.</li><br>
                                    <li> 
                                    Benchmarking: We benchmarked competitor websites, particularly in the premium watch and tech sectors, to gather ideas and ensure our ecommerce strategy was optimized for user engagement and conversion.
                                    </li><br>
                                    <li> 
                                    Simplifying content structure: One major design improvement was simplifying the site's typography and content hierarchy. The previous design had eight different heading styles, twelve subtitles, and five paragraph styles. I reduced these to four headings, four subtitles, and five paragraph styles, creating a more cohesive and readable experience without compromising on brand expression.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <p>If we provide users with quick navigation on the homepage and expose high-value features, we can improve user engagement. By presenting  content in a less overwhelming manner and explainining the meaning and features of these watches, we can boost user engagement. <br>
                                    On the other hand, it was important to work in a seo strategy align with the content. This way, we could revitalize a site that was previously underperforming and inactive, generating minimal revenue.

                                <p>I began with low-fidelity wireframes to establish the key user flows. The focus was on explain the Kronaby's hybrid watches are and creating a seamless way to process to see the watches features. The initial wireframes explored the structure of the home page, product page, and the landing pages. Once the wireframes were validated, we moved to high-fidelity designs.

                                <p>The color scheme was carefully crafted to reflect Kronaby's premium and modern identity. Neutral tones were paired with accent colors that highlighted the brand's innovative character.<br><br>For typography, the goal was to achieve an elegant yet readable style that complemented the overall aesthetic without overwhelming users. While the Kronaby app originally used Avenir Next for titles, buttons, and headers, and Minion for body text, these fonts were not part of Google Fonts and posed performance challenges. To address this, I chose DM Sans—a minimalist font that embodies Kronaby's refined personality while maintaining clarity and readability. This typography selection ensured that text was legible across various screen sizes, delivering a seamless user experience.<br><br></p>

                            The color palette was central to the design's success.  The primary palette, anchored by mint-cool-500 (#417178), established a sophisticated foundation.  The accent color, brown-500 (#785954), was selected as its complement.  A secondary palette, derived from the primary colors by adjusting their saturation and luminosity, was developed to provide visual interest and variety.<br>In addition to these, semantic colors played an important role.  The final palette is both elegant and effective.

                                <p>
                                    We kept the Kronaby redesign within the Bootstrap framework, aligning with the future move to Tailwind CSS across the Festina ecosystem. This helped maintain consistency and made it easier to integrate with other Festina brands down the line. To save time and effort, we reused components whenever possible. We only created new ones when absolutely necessary, always thinking about how they could be useful for other projects within the Festina family.<br>
                                    Since Kronaby offers hybrid connected watches, which can be a bit confusing for some, we needed a clear way to explain their features. There wasn't an existing component that could do this, so I designed a new one specifically for that purpose. I believe this component will be valuable for other Festina brands as well, especially as they start to incorporate more connected features into their watches.

                        <p>This project was completed during my final week of employment with Festina Group. As I was concurrently working on other projects, I delivered all design materials to another designer and provided comprehensive explanations to the development team.<br>
                        While I was unable to fully implement the UI within the checkout process due to time constraints, I will create a separate version to showcase my design approach and capabilities.</p>
